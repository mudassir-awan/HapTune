# ðŸ§¾ CONTRIBUTION LOG (Internal Reference)

This file documents the authorship and development contributions for the HapTune project. It is intended for internal use only (not for end-users), to serve as a record of design ownership, technical implementation, and authorship claims.

## Project Origins

- **Initial Context**  
  The earliest version of this tool was developed as part of a collaborative academic project involving two research teams. One team focused on the mechanical hardware component, while the other (at Kyung Hee University) was responsible for the haptic signal design.  
  This software was specifically developed to support force profile creation and visualization for integration with the mechanical system, under industry-sponsored research.

- **Original Name**  
  Initially titled **Interactive Wave Plotter**, the tool provided basic editing and visualization of low-frequency signals for early-stage experimental use.

- **Renaming and Evolution**  
  The tool was later redesigned, expanded, and renamed **HapTune** to reflect its broader functionality in haptic signal authoring, multi-frequency synthesis, and export.

- **Lead Developer & GUI Author**  
  The graphical interface, waveform editor, and core signal processing were independently implemented by **[Mudassir Ibrahim Awan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DJKWlwoAAAAJ)**, PhD student at Kyung Hee University, under academic supervision from **Prof. Seokhee Jeon**.

- **Scope Clarification**  
  The advanced features now present in HapTune; such as high-frequency vibration synthesis, envelope modulation, real-time spectral visualization, multi-tone control, and export toolsâ€”were **not part of the original collaborative scope** and were later developed independently by the author.



## Post-Project Expansion

- **Independent Extension**:  
  After the original research phase concluded, the developer (Mudassir) independently continued extending the tool:
  - Refactored GUI layout and architecture
  - Added multi-frequency vibration synthesis engine
  - Implemented waveform interpolation, DFT analysis, and export tools
  - Designed new signal editing workflows and envelope-based modulation

- **No institutional funding or mandate** was involved in this post-phase expansion.

## Submission History

- **Demo Submission**:  
  A subset of the current tool was submitted as a demonstration to the **IEEE World Haptics Conference 2025**. This included features independently developed after the original project.

## Authorship Positioning

- **Project Maintainer & Developer**:  
  [Mudassir Ibrahim Awan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DJKWlwoAAAAJ) â€” Original author and sole developer of the GUI system, signal engine, and waveform editing features in both the early and current versions of the software.

- **Academic Advisor**:  
  [Prof. Seokhee Jeon](http://haptics.khu.ac.kr/jeon/) â€” Supervised the development of the tool, originally titled **Interactive Wave Plotter**, during its use in a collaborative research project at Kyung Hee University.
